 PURPOSE
---------

This program is meant to parse through a given file and pull out the strings needed to create several monsters. The tags are in no order, but are as follows:

- NAME	: Name of the monster.
- DESC	: Description of the monster.
- COLOR	: What color the monster will be.
- SPEED	: The speed of the monster.
- ABIL	: The abilities that the monster will have.
- HP	: The health of the monster.
- DAM	: The damage that the monster deals.
- SYMB	: The symbol used to represent the monster.

 HOW TO RUN
------------

I put my code in a file called parser.cpp. It is in the folder "ass7_code". 
You'll have to compile that on it's own (I'm sorry for the trouble) and run it separately.
It will be added to the main code in the next project, but for now it is not necessary to be included.
